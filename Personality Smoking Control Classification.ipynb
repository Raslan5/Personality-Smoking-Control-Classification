deployed neural network to predict if the person has control over himself to not smoke if he wants to or not by using the personal traits attributes of the person and interpreting the output from the feature of whether he find it difficult to refrain from smoking where it is forbidden. We have manipulated and tuned with the parameters such as dropouts and batch de-normalization, etc. until we got satisfied with what we got, following the machine learning workflow technique we learned at the beginning of the semester, First our model train accuracy has reached 100%, which means over fitting with a low validation accuracy of around 50%, however when we increased the dropout value the train accuracy was decreasing while the accuracy of validation was increasing at the same time until we tuned such that both accuracy are almost the same value.
